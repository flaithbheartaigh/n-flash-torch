It is a simple torch to be used in symbian nokia phones. It uses the camera led or leds. Tested on C5-00 and on E75.

# Notes #

Nokia discontinued the symbian signed program so it is impossible to sign new application.

NFlashTorch can be installer unsigned afted applying the Norton Hack to bypass the certicate verification. ([Norton Hack](http://www.nokioteca.net/home/forum/index.php/topic/219219-hack-norton-per-3rd-5th-s3-belle-belle-fp1-non-necessita-di-flashing-ne-di-certificato/))

The latest version in the 0.2.2 version. It should be installed unsigned after the hack. So i published it unsigned. It can be downloaded from the dist folder:

[http://n-flash-torch.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/dist/NFlashTorch-0.2.2.sis](http://n-flash-torch.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/dist/NFlashTorch-0.2.2.sis)

The 0.2.2 version should resolve an always on flash bug, if the flash cannot be turned off. For example on the Nokia E75.

The version 0.2.1 is the latest that can be installed signed without the hack. Can be downloaded here
